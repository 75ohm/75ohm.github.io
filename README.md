# Hugo theme bootstrap-bare

This blog uses the [hugo-bootstrap-bare theme](https://gitlab.com/pixlsus/hugo-bootstrap-bare/-/tree/bootstrap5?ref_type=heads) from the bootstrap5 branch. As it has not seen any updates recently I decided to not reference it via a git submodule but copy it into this repository.
